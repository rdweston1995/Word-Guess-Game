What the Project Does:

This is a hangman game with a theme of Major Mountains from around the world. It cycles through an array to pick a random index and displays that words length in underscores and reads user input to fill those underscores with the correct letters. Helpful hints are displayed on the left hand side of the page. On the right hand side of the page theres the users stats with Wins, Loses, Remaining guesses, and the letters that they have already guessed so far whether they were correct or not. Once the user guesses the word correctly it'll pause the game until the button on the right hand side of the page is clicked on to reset the game. After the correct word is guessed a image of the Mountain and its location in its state or country is displayed. 

This project was incredibly useful with learning Javascript functions and user input. Theres still one bug that exists that I have found through testing and thats with the Word being Saint Helens where when you press space it will sometimes just auto choose a new word and reset the game. I also need to go back and make it so you don't need to guess the space in words. 

If you are looking to contribute to this project there can always be more mountains added to make the game more difficult. The lesser known the mountains the better such as Lhotse thats already in the game. Adding in the choice to pick a theme. I found the sites MDN, W3schools, and stackoverflow to be helpful sources for when I got stuck on a problem.

I maintain and have contributed to this project so far.
